# Abstract

The annual growth of the global energy consumption of digital technologies is 9%, hindering the EU Green Deal objective of
reducing 55% greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction by 2030. With the ever-increasing deployment of Internet of Things (IoT)
devices, Edge Computing (EC), and more specifically Edge Intelligence (EI) – which seeks to exploit these IoT (Edge) devices to process
Artificial Intelligence algorithms – has risen as a technology with booming demand potential, but which can also negatively
contribute to the global energy consumption and GHG emissions of digital technologies.
Regarding EC and EI, emissions-aware (in CO2 equivalent) simulation and orchestration solutions are still under-explored.
The LIGHTAIDGE project therefore focuses on light-weight, CO2 emissions-aware EI simulation and orchestration. It proposes
significant advances by (i) creating a bridge between High-Performance Computing (HPC) and EC communities through the
development of a novel, fast and scalable, CO2 emissions aware simulation framework for EC, and (ii) by producing light-weight, CO2
emissions aware Edge Intelligence orchestrators for low-CO2 EI model training.
Foreseen impacts are, at scientific level: the project will establish a bridge between HPC and EC/EI scientific communities, and will
pave the path to future, CO2 emissions aware EC and EI research. At technological, economical and societal levels: the project will
reduce R&D costs by enabling an economically viable EC and EI prototyping through simulations, will help to drive EI companies in
the climate transition by reducing the EI's CO2 emissions through better orchestration, and will contribute to reduce the CO2
emissions due to digital technologies, participating in the European Union Green Deal's objective. The project also proposes training, transfer of knowledge, and dissemination/communication activities for the researcher, constituting a solid path to develop his skills and experience.
