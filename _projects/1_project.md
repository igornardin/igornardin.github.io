DATAZERO2 (2020-2024) aims at improving the operation and design of cooperating datacenters operated only with renewable energies, in particular using disruptive approaches for uncertainty management, cooling and power distribution. The second objective is to propose a comprehensive knowledge base and toolbox for industry and researchers for zero-emission datacenters beyond state-of-the-art solutions.
