Cloud computing and its many variations offer users considerable computing and storage capacities. The maturity of virtualization techniques has enabled the emergence of complex virtualized infrastructures, capable of rapidly deploying and reconfiguring virtual and elastic resources in increasingly distributed infrastructures. This resource management, transparent to users, gives the illusion of access to flexible, unlimited and almost immaterial resources. However, the power consumption of these clouds is very real and worrying, as are their overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the consumption of critical raw materials used in their manufacture. In a context where climate change is becoming more visible and impressive every year, with serious consequences for people and the planet, all sectors (transport, building, agriculture, industry, etc.) must contribute to the effort to reduce GHG emissions. Despite their ability to optimize processes in other sectors (transport, energy, agriculture), clouds are not immune to this observation: the increasing slope of their greenhouse gas emissions must be reversed, otherwise their potential benefits in other sectors will be erased. This is why the CARECloud project (understanding, improving, reducing the environmental impacts of Cloud Computing) aims to drastically reduce the environmental impacts of cloud infrastructures.
